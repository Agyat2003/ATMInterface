# ATMInterface
Created an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface project in Java involves building a software application that simulates the functionalities of a real ATM, allowing users to perform banking operations. Here's a high-level summary of the key components and steps involved in such a project:

1. User Authentication:

Implement a login system to authenticate users with their account information, which typically includes an account number and a PIN (Personal Identification Number).
2. Account Management:

Provide options for users to check their account balance, view transaction history, and change their PIN.
3. Transaction Processing:

Allow users to perform various banking transactions, including:
Cash withdrawals
Cash deposits
Fund transfers between accounts
Balance inquiries
Printing of transaction receipts
4. Security Measures:

Implement security features to protect user data and transactions, such as encryption for PIN and transaction data.
5. Error Handling:

Develop a robust error-handling system to manage issues like insufficient funds, incorrect PINs, or technical errors during transactions.
